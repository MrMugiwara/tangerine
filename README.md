Tangerine
=========

Tool for inspecting Windows Phone applications. Based on [XAPSpy](http://github.com/sensepost/xapspy). Allows you to do three things:

 - Automate all routine work with XAP files
 - Log method calls, including parameters values and return values
 - Run your own code on method enter, on method exit or instead of a method
 - Change parameters values using method code

Current limitations on functions for instrumentating:
 - does not support functions with user types (e.g. custom type Product)
 - does not support out parameters
 - does not support method overloads

Currently supports Windows Phone 7 applications only. Has not been tested with Windows Phone 8 applications yet!

Requirements: .NET Framework 4.0, Windows Phone SDK 7.1

More detailed documentation will be uploaded.
