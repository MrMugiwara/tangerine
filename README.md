Tangerine
=========

Tool for inspecting Windows Phone applications. Based on [XAPSpy](http://github.com/sensepost/xapspy). Allows you to do three things:

 - Automate all routine work with XAP files
 - Log method calls, including parameters values and return values
 - Run your own code on method enter, method exit or instead of a method

Currently supports Windows Phone 7 application only. Has not been tested with Windows Phone 8 applications yet!

More detailed documentation will be uploaded.
